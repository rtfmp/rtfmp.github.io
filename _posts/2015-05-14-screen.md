Start a screen session

    $screen

Detach from the screen session

    Ctrl+a d
    (Hit Ctrl+a quickly followed by hitting just d)

List current screen sessions

    $ screen -ls
    There is a screen on:
    1119.pts-0.acer11 (Detached)
    1 Socket in /run/screens/S-brm.

screen -list does the same thing.

Attach to this screen session

    $screen - r

Attach to an already attached screen. That is , if the session is already attached by someone else or somewhere else. The other person will able to see what you type on the terminal, a nice way to share screen.

    $screen -x

Terminate the screen session

    (Ctrl+a k)
    (Hit Ctrl+a quickly followed by hitting k)

Alternate ways to terminate screen session is `Ctrl+d` or `exit` as you would on a shell session.Â But only Ctrl+a k asks for confirmation like this:

     kill this window [y/n]

After terminating a screen session, you should see something like this, you are taken back to the prompt where you started or attached the session.

    [screen is terminating]
    $

Now there are no screen session.

    $ screen -ls
    No Sockets found in /run/screens/S-brm.

Attach to a session when there are multiple sessions
There are three sessions here:

    $screen -ls
    There are screens on:
    1209.pts-0.acer11 (Detached)
    1205.pts-0.acer11 (Detached)
    1202.pts-0.acer11 (Detached)
    3 Sockets in /run/screens/S-brm.

To attach to the middle one 1205.pts-0.acer11 (Detached):

    $screen -r 1205.pts-0.acer11
    or just
    $screen -r 1205

If the session is already attached by someone else, somewhere

    $screen -x 1205

To name a session while starting for easy reference

    $screen -S SessionName

SessionName given will now appear in screen -ls output

To change the window title

    $screen -t Newtitle

I find this useful to see where I am.

How I can tell I am in a screen session and which session?

    $ echo $STY
    1209.pts-0.acer11

Compare the output from screen -ls. If you are not attached to any screen session, you get a blank output.
